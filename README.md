## Assignments and Labs  

### LAB 1: Ohmâ€™s Law  
- Explored the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in circuits.  

### LAB 2: LED Blinking (Digital)  
- Programmed the ESP32 to blink an LED using digital output signals.  

### LAB 3: Counter Switch (Digital)  
- Created a counter controlled by a switch, showcasing interaction through digital input and output.  

### LAB 4: Potentiometer (Analog)  
- Utilized a potentiometer to read analog input and control system output.  

### LAB 5: DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor (Analog)  
- Collected temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor and displayed it via serial output.  

### LAB 6: DHT22 with OLED  
- Integrated the DHT22 sensor with an OLED display to show live temperature and humidity readings.
